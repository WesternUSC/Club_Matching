                <h4>What is Clubs Week?</h4>
                <p>Clubs Week usually takes place in September each year. It showcases all of the clubs and provides
                    students with a chance to learn more about the opportunities available with each club.</p>

                <h4>How long is the quiz and how does it work?</h4>
                <p>The quiz is a total of 25 questions and will approximately take 5 minutes.</p>
                <p>We ask a representative from each club to take the exact same quiz. We find the three clubs with
                    the
                    highest similarity to your set of answers.</p>
