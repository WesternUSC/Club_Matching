    "Short description": "Hi everyone! Welcome to the A Cappella Association of Western University. Here at ACA-Western, we have three amazing a cappella groups for you to join. Here's a bit about them...The A Cappella Project (TAP) is our non-competitive, co-ed a cappella group. It serves as open forum for those interested in singing, arranging, and beatboxing. Tap accepts members regardless of experience, and hope to improve members' vocal techniques and performance skills. TAP is ACA's largest group!Equivox is our competitive, co-ed a cappella group. Founded in 2017, Equivox has gone on to perform at the ICCA quarterfinals twice, as well as the Queen's University Annual A Cappella competition. You can join Equivox by audition!Repercussions is our newest group here at ACA-Western! Repercussions is a competitive, all-female a cappella group that has performed at the ICCAs (International Collegiate Championships of A Cappella) as well as been accepted to the Queens University Annual A Cappella Competition. You can join Repercussions by audition! It is worth nothing that members in our competitive groups typically have considerable musical experience and a lot of time to dedicate to a cappella rehearsals, competitions, and more.Due to COVID-19, ACA-Western will be run completely online for the 2020-2021 school year. It is going to be a blast! We hope to provide everyone with a welcoming environment of people who have been brought together by our shared love of music. We will be getting up to all sorts of silliness, having virtual karaoke nights, performing in online competitions, enjoying murder mystery dinners and more! Come to our Annual General Meeting on September 25th at 6:30PM via Zoom to meet our team and get more info! See you there!"

Both of these goals go hand-in-hand: without the financial support, research centres can't make life-saving discoveries and without the education, you won't know about the cause you're donating to. Inspired by the ground-breaking research taking place in facilities such as the McEwen Center for Regenerative Medicine, the Schulich school of Medicine & Dentistry and the Sprott Center for Stem Cell Research. CARRM believes in the untapped potential of regenerative medicine and its wide range of applications. From treating diabetes to potentially counteracting the degenerative effects of Alzheimer's, regenerative medicine is not only the future of healthcare, but a symbol of hope, down to its fundamental unit--the stem cell."

An education in music is incredibly beneficial for young childrenâ€”we know that it helps develop interpersonal skills, goal-setting skills, motivation, and resiliency. We believe that vulnerable children should be granted the same opportunities for growth and development that a music education provides that are available to their peers. This year, we will run live virtual lessons over Zoom and offer asynchronous lessons over YouTube for our community partners. Join us, as a volunteer or executive, in making music education more accessible than ever and supporting vulnerable children in your community! Check out our flyer for more information and the QR code to our Zoom booth, which will run from 10AM to 4PM Monday through Thursday, and 10AM to 1PM on Friday!"

The club will facilitate networking between our club members and other local, national, and international organizations. Due to the unexpected changes caused by COVID-19, the club will now be running virtually through Zoom.

Our main priority remains the same, however, we will not be able to host any in-person activities for the time being. The award is achieved by students making a bimonthly commitment to take part in physical recreation, community volunteering, and personal skill development of their choice. The award is internationally recognized for developing individuals who are dedicated, interesting, and active within their communities. It leaves requirements open-ended for students to decide their activities based upon their interests, and it also allows students to complete the award at their own pace. The Western Duke of Edinburgh's Club is meant for UWO students to become involved, build a strong campus community, and to develop their own personal interests through this unique opportunity."

MOTIVATION: Artificial intelligence is one of the fastest growing technologies because of its seemingly endless range of possible applications, such as predicting the stock markets or controlling self-driving cars. Due to the rate at which the technology is being developed and adopted, businesses are investing more and more into searching for young talent at the undergraduate level. WAID offers Western students the opportunity to develop applicable skills and establish a foundation from which to launch careers in artificial intelligence. STRATEGY: The primary goal of WAID is to provide an opportunity to gain knowledge and experience in artificial intelligence through education and project development. Since artificial intelligence is a broad field with several subdivisions, the club will initially focus on machine learning, due to its widespread popularity, and aim to expand into other subdivisions in the future. WAID intends to support members by hosting educationals and providing resources for ongoing individual learning throughout the year. Members who apply and are selected to form project teams will be mentored by caring and compassionate project managers who will help to ensure projects remain on track. These activities will allow students with no prior machine learning experience to learn and contribute to the team projects. The year will conclude with a project showcase where each team will present their work to the rest of the club."

    "Short description": "Student Energy at Western University (SEWU) seeks to provide students with the knowledge, connections, resources and practical experiences that will inspire and empower us to lead the just transition to a sustainable energy system. See our introductory video here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uB3bPo29fOnzWfl922lvWjle0BWkkYVs/view?usp=sharingSEWU joins 43 other Student Energy chapters in 24 countries developing the next generation of leaders to champion an equitable and sustainable energy system. Since its first year at Western in the fall of 2019, our club has hosted a model energy policy negotiation and climate simulation, a movie night on fusion energy featuring a Q&A with leading international fusion researchers, and partnered with Facilities Management and EnviroWestern to host Westernâ€™s first pitch competition for solutions that will help the university achieve carbon neutrality. SEWU has also led a number of advocacy, education and service initiatives, from rallying against pipelines being forced through indigenous lands, to tree planting and lobbying Westernâ€™s administration to adopt more ambitious emissions targets and divest our endowment from fossil fuels.Students interested in joining SEWU are encouraged to send us a message and introduce themselves via our Facebook, Instagram, or email. We look forward to welcoming you to our community!"
